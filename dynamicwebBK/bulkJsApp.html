	Below you will find what I believe is the only point specifically

	number of ways it can be done. If you look closely the exit points are
	specific calls to methods of other specifically purposed objects, that
	can not request the neccasary information from this object directly.
	It must be given to them, thus the use of multiple private methods and
	calls to public members of global objects. Adding other objects/response 
	formats may be difficult in this setup. I believe the objects and
