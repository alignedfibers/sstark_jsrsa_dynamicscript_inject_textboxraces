<!-- The intent of this script is cto handle the addition of multiple document elements 
where the element added is prototyped to: or by default: handles events such as a script 
element with the onload/callback attribute set. Uses xss style injection and is documentation in code  
regarding how I would like to manage source data, libraries, commands and applications. 
Many notes have been removed. -->

	you will see when this runs that the makecall method is called multiple times and continues to run independent of the callback assigned
	to onload, unsure if there is a possible issue with multiple onloads using same callback, or if events stack and run in order
	you must instantiate a new transUnit for each script request, because the object maintains the loaded state, in future will pass itself to
	callback and be assigned as the manager for that script, hooking events and dependencies when the script loads renaming itself and
	assigning itself to the correct global array, denoting type and scope such that shared resources can be accessed by namespace 
	/top-level-name/name-local/other-local/shouldntB2deep resources are accessable anywhere down the chain, dependencies may be listed as multiple chains
	wildcards for dependencies should be added at some point. These are wrapper objects and  should be capable of loading any further dependencies
	requested by the script not already loaded - in the initial load the script receieved should define these but does not do the functionality. Should also check
	out instances of anything that is needed by the script such as windowing kit so messages can be passed to the windowing manager
	to allow windows to be moved to front of stack, we do not count all windows we simply send a unique id and window instance to manager to do 
	an action on the specific window, where sizing, focus and display are applied to the window, it is double hooked so to make it possible to
	introduce a new window to the manager instead of requesting a new window from the manager, manager should be able to understand what you
	send it, nothing is strictly defined, not all windows need to look the same however some base functionality must be agreed to be handled by manager
	such that all windows have certain properties and can supply change requests to manager that are not local to itself 
	(screen position, size exc, how action icons and such are interfaced is up to the window itself, you request windows from your kit, to bind windows 
	in panes or subwindow you must send the window instances to the manager, grids and such can be created... only applications get windows, 
	cmds and libs do not, a console window is created for all apps though it may not always be visible, a main monitor console can also be turned on
	as all events and command calls log to that buffer stating who when where exc. That buffer can be setup to send the data to elasticsearch, usable consoles
	can be created in any app and have access to the commands, libs exc. defined by the chains that the app has hooked at some point app may need a token to
	hook a lib*/

	Below you will find what I believe is the only point specifically 
	designated as an entry point. You may find that within my scripting 
	techniques that a clear exit point may be hard to find. There is good
	reason for this and to do what I am trying to do there is only a limited
	number of ways it can be done. If you look closely the exit points are
	specific calls to methods of other specifically purposed objects, that
	can not request the neccasary information from this object directly.
	It must be given to them, thus the use of multiple private methods and
	calls to public members of global objects. Adding other objects/response 
	formats may be difficult in this setup. I believe the objects and 
	capabilities I provide are enouph to accomplish any task you would like 
	under this scenerio. (2010)
